# Building the App

To build our app the following tools will be needed:
    
* Android Studio (Latest version is fine)
    * Standard Installation
    * Do not import settings
    * Install everything (Agree to all Fine Print)
* JDK 18
* Gradle

1. Open RemindMed folder in root of project via Android Studio
2. Wait a few minutes to allow for the gradle build to happen, you'll know it is done when the green play button is available.
2.You can click play to run the app on the top bar of Android Studio. Alternatively use Shift + F10 (Windows), Control + R (macOS).
3. The app should open on the right, if it doesn't then please click on "Running Devices" on the right bar of Android Studio and the app should appear.
4. (Not to worry, this step will never occur!) If all else fails, contact s295ali@uwaterloo.ca.
